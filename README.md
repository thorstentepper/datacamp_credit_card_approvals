### Project Title
Predicting Credit Card Approvals

### Description
This project uses supervised machine learning to build a predictor for credit
card approvals. The dataset is preprocessed by addressing differences in data type
and scale as well as missing entries. Separate datasets for training and testing
are created and a logistic regression model is fit to the train set. Finally,
predictions are made based on the test set and model performance is evaluated
and improved via parameter tuning.

### Files used
The project uses one data-file available via DataCamp: 'cc_approvals.data'

### Credits
Sayak Paul created the project tasks for DataCamp. The Python code in this
repository was accepted as my solution to the project.
